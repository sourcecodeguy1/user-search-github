# GitHub User Search Application

This application allows users to search for GitHub profiles using the GitHub username. It is a React-based application that provides a simple and responsive user interface to make API requests to GitHub and display user data.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can enter a GitHub username into the search bar and either click the "Search" button or press "Enter" to initiate the search.
- **Input Validation**: The application checks if the search input is not empty before making a request.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is built using `mdb-react-ui-kit` to ensure that the search bar and other components are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Error Handling**: Users are alerted if they attempt to search without entering a username.
